# Lab 4:

## The following bug was found and corrected by myself and Dylan Rees (dylanrees@protonmail.ch):
### https://bugs.freebsd.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=212942

## There was a broken link that was no longer valid within the FreeBSD handbook. The link was no longer necessary in context and was outdated so we removed the link along with the corresponding sentence in the XML source code for the handbook. It is important to maintain accurate and readable documentation so developers are able to correctly use code within their work. A lot of the development process includes referencing documentation to learn more about the functionality of the code that one is using, so making sure that the documentation is well-maintained is crucial since it will effect all that use it. Through this lab, I have learned how to maintain open source documentation, but I have also learned that a lot of the bugs in documentation may go unnoticed at first glance. This is important because any bugs that aren't fixed will affect developers who might otherwise trust the documentation without question.
