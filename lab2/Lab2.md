# 02. By definition, licenses are permissions from an authority to own or use something such as code. As a developer, it is important to include the appropriate licenses in your work so other developers are aware of how you authorize them to use your code. If you choose to not use a license, the default copyright laws apply to your source code, so nobody else may reproduce, distribute or create derivative works from your your code. Also, if you choose not use a license, but you choose to publish your code on sites such as GitHub or StackOverflow, then you are subject to the default licensing terms for your post on their site which would grant other users some rights that you may not have intended. For example, code without included licenses on GitHub by default allow other users to view and fork your repository.

# 03. If a project does not have an explicit, then the project is subject to the default licensing terms of the site it is published on. A user who posts their projects on sites like GitHub might be unaware of the licensing terms they accept when they publish their work on that site which might not have been intended by that user. This would at least allow other users to view the source code which might not have been the intent of the person who created it. This lapse in communication and understanding can lead to legal licensing disputes which can have negative consequences for both parties.

# 04. I agree that Gopher's failure to follow the Open System Model attributed to it's downfall and ultimately the rise to the World Wide Web. Not following the the model led to limitations that shut out possibilities for developers. This led to the less developments for Gopher until it was overtaken by the Web.

# 05. Android uses the Apache License 2.0 so it can allow users to use and modify the Android OS however they wish with a patent license as long as the required noticed are included with each modification. This is also a great example of how open-source software can greatly benefit developers for growth. However, the Android kernel is licensed under GPL v2.0 so that developers are allowed to copy, distribute, and modify the kernel as long as each modification is tracked in the source files.
