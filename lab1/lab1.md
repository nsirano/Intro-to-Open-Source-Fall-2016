# c3. After reading the excerpt from "Free Culture" I have further validated my frustration with copyright laws. Copyright lawsuits can occur when someone when someone knowingly pirates copyrighted material. The RIAA justifies those lawsuits by claiming that illegally pirating music hurts the industry by reducing the payout towards artists. Even if that claim is true, it does not seem like a reasonable argument when the president of the RIAA makes twenty times as much as the average recording artist from their music. One can infer that the act of pirating music hurts the profits of the companies in the recording industry substantially more than the artists that generate that revenue for them. If someone is knowingly pirating music, getting a lawsuit from the RIAA seems reasonable with respect to the artists, but unreasonable with respect to where the money you would have spent on the music would have gone. However, copyright lawsuits can occur when there is a negligence from one party in failing to prevent copyright infringement. The lawsuit that was described in the excerpt details the case where an RPI student created a search engine within the school's network. This side-project was only a simple search engine that the student created to index publicly available files on the network and was never created with any intent to better aid pirates. Since audio files were indexed under his search engine like all other files, the student was handed a brutally unfair lawsuit from the RIAA because other students from the school used the search engine to share music. This kind of lawsuit is exactly why copyright laws are too extreme for most cases and cost much more to the offender, whether they were guilty or not, than any proposed loss of revenue to the record label or artist. For example, each infringement would cost the offender $150,000. That much money can buy 150,000 songs through the Apple Music store, but thats the cost for infringing copyright even once. The punishments for petty crimes like copyright infringement should be more fair and balanced and legal system should not be abused to profit from someone's minor mistake to the point where it ruins their lives financially.

# g.  I am interested in doing a project that would relate to either data visualization, or improving social communication between people within a certain number of miles from each other. I have not thought of any ideas that would be a more detailed and doable project, but I am looking forward to exploring my options this semester.
